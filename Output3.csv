0,I came to Chicago on business and was initially supposed to stay downtown; however a colleague recommended this hotel--and I am so glad that they did! The attention to detail and finishing touches in my room are what made this hotel feel like home. Staying in a smaller hotel allowed me to connect with the local Chicago vibe while simultaneously enjoying exquisite service from the staff at a fraction of what it might cost to stay in a Magnificent Mile high-rise. Considering the quality ambiance and charm of this hidden Chicago treasure it made my trip a memorable experience. Not only was I able to secure a bike rental to avoid the high cost of renting a car but I also was directed to some of the local galleries in the West Loop by the friendly staff members.
0,I still love this place but the took Mu Shu off the menu. Â I am deeply saddened. Show owner comment Â»

0,My family has been using Korean Air for many many years now. Going to Asia Korean Air is one of the lowest priced airlines and yet their service is not compromised. The flight attendants are lovely professional and polite. Check in is good and the meals served are also good. The only thing is that if you have to speak with their customer service line it's quite hard to communicate with their staff. Luckily I have some Korean friends and they have done the talking for us otherwise it couldve been worse. All their baggage policies are the standard international size and weight limitations. I suggest not only with this airline but with all airlines to familiarize yourself with their change cancellation and baggage policies before you commit. Airlines will serve the food their country
0,I hadn't been to Grisanti's since a pre-homecoming dinner in high school so I had no idea what to expect. Â But since I had watched a cooking show that involved homemade ravioli last night that's what I had my heart set on when we arrived. Â I figured... Italian Restaurant has to have ravioli right? Well long story short they didn't (except for the fried appetizer kind) and I settled for spinach and chicken manicotti. Â But before I got to that I indulged in copious amounts of the complementary never-ending butter-injected bread with marinara sauce. Â Then I opted for a cup of 'roasted onion soup' in lieu of salad (but had salad also since everyone else at the table ordered it and it was served family style). Â  The soup (which I guess they don't want to call 'French Onion' since that woul
0,I have eyed this shop at the Old orchard location and was thrilled to have time to wander into the Evanston shop. First off- let me say the the you girl who was working (short reddish hair glasses and piercings) was incredibly friendly and helpful. Â My mother and I were in the shop close to closing time but that did not deter her from grabbing other merchandise to show us and really helping us! Â She was ab Fab. The pricing is incredibly cheap. Â I picked up a cape/sweater thing for the office for 38$. Â My mother picked up a great sweater to throw on to go shopping etc for the same price. I mean really. Â 38$? Â  The selection of gifts and cards is really cute. Â I am a fan of this place!
1,The highlight is the unique menu. The assorted pancakes waffles and other breakfast goodness make it a great breakfast choice. The portions are generous the ingredients are fresh and the flavors are wonderful! The service and atmosphere are also both amazing. The one downside is that they really back you in here when they are busy but business is business!
0,So this was my first Yelp outing... I arrived right around 7:30 pm - a few others were there before me - we had to stand outside for a few minutes - which did not bother me. We had a little room in the back to ourselves. Before ordering we had to negotiate with our server about the fact that several of us needed to have separate checks as we were paying with credit cards - our server tried to make this into a difficult task - but in the end we got what we wanted. I eagerly looked over the menu since I had heard good things about this place. I was disappointed to see that there was no Poki offering on the menu. So I asked anyway - no no Poki. So then I ordered Miso soup Edamame and a variety of rolls and Nigiri sashimi. First I was informed that they were out of Edamame then out of sc
0,Not having a sweet tooth not being a non-cupcake aficionado I love Yelp for pointing out little gems like the Hummingbird Bakery. Am I right in saying that cupcakes are an American obsession which is slowly translating itself across the Atlantic and in years to come just like the indigenous red squirrels of today we'll be creating special protected areas to try to stop the humble English custard tart from being wiped out by its more aggressive American cake cousin? From the outside the cute arrangement of the different coloured tarts in the window display made me think it was an art gallery until the words Hummingbird Bakery over the shop triggered the latent Yelp memories. So I told my friend confidently that this was the best cupcake in town according to my knowledgeable Yelp friends
0,Ok the wait this time was decent despite a packed house. Â I went at 12:45 so perhaps that made the difference. Â Back to 3 stars. We split a dragon roll Â a spicy salmon roll and a crab salad roll. Â So sue us we were hungry. Â  The eel on the dragon roll was really good this time-- fresh and moist. Â The salmon was fantastic-- really fresh high quality vibrant and buttery. Â Points for drsssing the salmon so it lacked any of those tough stringy things. Â You know what I'm talking about. Â Those things completely ruin a bite of sushi for me. Â The edamame were slightly overcooked. Â Like I said we were hungry. Â  If the quality remains this high consistently they will remain in my good graces. Â And isn't that what everyone wants?
0,My sisters told me at a very young age that when buying a girl a gift you can never go wrong with things that come in little blue boxes. I took that advice to heart and have been making girls happy as I can be ever since. If you know me then you know that if you are dating me around your birthday valentines day or christmas your going to get hooked up with some Tiffany's bling You can ask all my ex's even the ones that hate me they will tell you they have made out especially at Christmas. This year is no exception except I have no one girl to buy a buying a bunch of presents. So I am buying a bunch of gifts for a couple of special girls. Usually I make three or four trips during the holidays and today was trip number one of Â many to pick up a few things. There are all kinds of grea
1,If you think being past out in the backseat of a cab is proof of a kick-ass night well you're wrong. To end the night with a bang you MUST go to Mai's Restaurant for a late night snack (read: feast). It's also a good choice for lunch/casual dinner. Entrees are served family-style (big plates serving spoon) so sharing is encouraged. Top picks: Start off with spring rolls served with mounds of fresh greens (you'll need that extra hydration boozehounds); Vietnamese egg rolls steaming hot crispy goodness with a side of jalepeno-adorned fish sauce; garlic beef (or chicken) infused with soppy sauce veggies and piles of fully-cooked and soft garlic cloves--almost as savory as the meat--and of course fried rice. For the faithful Tex-Mex fan they event have a Vietnamese carne gisada. Yo
0,I loved Daytons. I was peeved about Fields. I was totally bummed with Macy's. In general this place is crap BUT it is the only place in MN to get the Thomas Pink Shirts and for that reason alone I must support it. What can I say I'm a sucker for my hubby in PINK.
0,BJ's recently opened a location over in Virginia Gateway in Gainesville VA. I received an invitation in the mail for a two month trial membership - so I went in to check it out. I had the option of signing up for a year beyond the 2 month trial membership for $40.00. If I waited for the 2 month trial membership to expire and then make a decision on membership - at that point the price would be $50.00 for a year. So I went ahead and signed up for the year - which means I have 14 months for $40.00. Because the place is so new the place looks nice and clean. I went and stocked up on things like bottled water dishwasher detergent and dishwasher drying agent. The one thing I will ding them on is their Membership Services area seemed a little disorganized. There were five people behind the c
0,After a long night of being the designated driver and driving my drunk friends back home...i stopped at Mobil in Cromwell for gas when i went inside they had just stocked the donut case and they looked amazing. Asked the clerk where they were from and he said Sugar Shack in Manchester..... These were some of the most incredible donuts ever...beats anything else in the state hands down.
0,I wish I could give another star but was disappointed in the service. The staff is great and friendly we were just there for about 2 hours just to eat breakfast. Thank goodness they served us a mini-muffin prior to our order coming out I was hungry! My friend and I went in and let them know we were going to sit outside. They noted they would be right out to service. We waited about 15 minutes. Once we placed our order we had another friend join us about 30 min later and place an order. Our third friend got his breakfast in a matter of 10 minutes. It was over an hour later when they noted they messed up our order (cook staff was looking at tables 1 & 2 vs. our table #12) ....something to that effect. We had ordered the Southern Comfort breakfast - Chicken Fried Steak 2 eggs hashbrowns
0,I always get great haircuts here and I have difficult hair. Â The shop is unpretentious and there was no waiting. Â Natilee takes the time necessary to do it right. The only thing that would make Natilee's better for me is if her shop was closer to my office. Â Still the drive is worthwhile. Call to make an appointment and don't be late. Â Natilee runs on-time and works fast. Final thoughts: Â If you don't already know who Steve McQueen was and what he's famous for you might want to brush up on that before you go. Â You'll still get a killer haircut but the conversation will be more interesting if you're conversant about Steve. P.S. Â Natilee does great work at a very reasonable price so tip well.
0,I attended a funeral reception here recently and it was exactly what you would expect and nothing more. Â In writing this review I realized that places like this exist for funerals. Â It was interesting that the place had 2 funeral parties going on at once. Â It doesn't matter how good the food and the atmosphere are when you are gathering people for a quick funeral meal. Â For that I retract a few of the previous comments. Â The meal was average but it was served by people who really seemed to care that we were happy and enjoying ourselves. Â The the bartenders and waitstaff were incredibly nice. Â The gentlemen at the stale cigarette-smelling bar kept us all happy. The appetizers were deviled eggs and sausage in a brown gravy. Â  Â The meal was a variety of sides beef and gravy and roaste
0,is there really a lazy river here
0,"Well I drove an hour into Boston for their Japanese hot dogs and despite that being their main source of revenue (they have about 15 to choose from) they were out of hot dogs.. and sausages.. So.. I guess all I can review is that a hotdog joint ran out of hotdogs. And I couldn't understand a damn word she said other than we have no more hotdogs or sausages"". Luckily there's plenty of other good food in Chinatown."""
0,I know I've already reviewed Carlos & Pepe's but I do have to say - coming from someone who grew up in California: that this is the most delicious most authentic Mexican I have ever had in Florida. Â The service could use a little tweaking but no one is perfect. Â  I wish they were open for lunch as well!
0,I've been going to The Works since I can remember. Â My grandfather used to own a business that was right next door to the works and because my brother and I would constantly be with my grandparents The Works would be a hangout spot for us. Â I remember getting their cheese fries and their vanilla ice cream and having the only woman who was ever behind the counter take a bite of it before giving it to me. Now after 18 years I still go back every now and then for their gyros and their cheese fries. Â The gyros are carved off the spit as soon as you order it and then put on the grill for a couple of minutes or so giving the pieces a nice crisp edge. Â With their tzatziki sauce tomatoes and wrapped in a warm pita it is the perfect lunch or dinner. Â Their cheese fries taste the way I always r
0,QuikTrip is great for sooo many reasons. * All of their stores are always clean and well lit. * You get greeted when you walk inside. * They take checks (seriously this comes in handy every once-in-a-while). * Gas prices are usually the lowest in town. * All of their fuel products are guaranteed although I'm not really sure what that means. This location is just over the train tracks in Vinings about a mile from I-285. It's usually really busy but you can get in and out easily. Careful trying to make a left-hand turn out of here because it gets tricky during rush hour.
0,This is a well-run sonic. It's in a good location (by Arby's and Lowe's) and the food is always fast and fresh. The only complaint is that they don't have a drive thru but the service is usually fast so it's not really a problem.
0,Let me preface this with I have NOT had their pizza however the reason for the review is their delivery drivers....I witnessed one cut off a driver nearly causing a multi car accident! Then several weeks later my sister calls me very shaken up because she was cut off by one of their drivers. She had to swerve to avoid getting hit and ended up off the road with her 2 year old in the car! I understand people want to get their food fast but there's a fine line between fast and reckless these drivers are reckless!
1,Food is great and innovative. Â Have yet to be dissapointed. Â Gets quite busy at times. Â Not all servers were great but none the less I am happy.
0,The IHOP in my neighborhood closed after 50 years and we kind of miss them for a cheap breakfast. I wish they'd tear down the old building and build us a new one like this location. The inside is more modern but still very compact and tight. They make use of every inch but doing so puts the tables close together. It also makes the table tops small and crowded once your food arrives. However IHOP serves up a good cheap breakfast. Their Breakfast Sampler gives you everything you'd want for your morning meal. You'll enjoy two of everything; eggs your way bacon sausage ham pancakes and a hearty side of hash browns. Â It's almost too much food I always bring some bacon and sausage home for the dogs. I like my Hash Browns extra crispy and today when ordering I forgot to mention my quirky 
0,The inside of this place seems awesome. a little bit cleaner than most targets that I have visited. The reason for the lower rating is the parking situation. There is a parking garage and a lot. The lot has walk-ways to get to and from the store to your car and the car returns are in odd places. Maybe I just have never seen a place like this before but it will take some getting used to.
0,Preppie Paradise. Â  The crocodile is back! Â It's a little smaller in size but just as charming. Â Or perhaps more. Â As I was leaving the store the cashier rang up a customer's bill. Â Over $2000. Â  It's medium sized store but I found a lot of adorable pieces too. Â Most items range from $75-$125 each. Â The current women's collection is overwhelmingly pastel heavy. Â I would advise any female more than 30 pounds overweight to avoid this season's selection unless she wants to look like a lumpy Easter egg with legs. Â (Hey I'm just trying to HELP you. Â I can't pull off every look either!) Everything in the store is neatly folded Â hung or displayed. Â Many items come in a variety of bright colors. Â (Would you like pastel pastel or pastel?) Don't worry if you suffer from any of the following
1,Excellent doctors and awesome staff... Highly recommended...
0,I love options. This place has them. I never ever ever skip the opportunity to try a Mexican place when suggested and recommended by a friend or family member. My mom knows good Mexican and she brought me here. I must say I chose simple tacos al carbon (al pastor - with onions and cilantro) and they were quite delicious. Of course I had to stab my fork into every ones plates to taste what they were having (fajitas tamales etc) and the guac was fan-flippin'- tastic. Is it because I love avocado's in all their delicious green forms? I do not know maybe. You try it and tell me if you agree.
0,Disclaimer: I have a love hate relationship with this place... but for mostly personal reasons. Open Mic night on Mondays and live music throughout the week is pretty cool. On Mondays a lot of local bands will be up on stage doing their thing. Bartenders are quick and the prices are cheap. I strongly disagree with pregnant people (bartender on duty) taking shots... hmmm something about being prego and drinking just doesn't sit right with me... Overall a dive bar with a fun crowd.
0,We went here last night after a long hiatus. Â  I have to say that I have been to far better F&H locations in DFW. This location has a smoking room but the main room seems to smell anyway. Â Infact I left with a sore throat and Hubby woke up with one this morning. Perhaps it was b/c we were screaming over the spotty music. Â Pearl Jam POTUSA Oasis = yes. Â Everything else = no. Â Bonus points for music videos remember those? Hubby ran into an old football college buddy so we were a party of three last night. Â We shared cheese fries which suited us as dinner and I woke up not even hungry for breakfast. Major portions here. Why was I carded to get in when the white trash family that entered an hour later was able to bring in a 6 month old? Â That is quite underage. Clean bathrooms rotating da
0,Everything went well as planned. Â Comfort and information was provided. Â Couldn't ask for more as far as shoulder surgery is considered. Â Dr. Snyder was great.
0,UPDATE: Rocky's has unfortunately gone under new management (again) and have regrettably become inedible. To begin with the pizza has no sauce the cheese tastes like plastic and the service is sub-par to mediocre. I can tell that the new owners want to make the business successful but at the cost of sacrificing quality? Come on! Looks like the quest for a pizza joint lingers on... :-(
1,FOOD: Â is excellent high-quality and tasty all around. Â The pot pie chicken salad sandwich minestrone soup and all desserts especially the frosted mocha are great. SERVICE: Â is always friendly and competent even when things are bustling which is often the case. Â My only small complaint is that they close way too early on Sundays (5:00 pm!). AMBIANCE: Â there is ample indoor and patio seating and its open and airy. Â It's an educated and hip crowd. VALUE: Â is decent given the location and what you get.
0,I believe this to be the best BBQ in the entire state of South Carolina. I've had several others that were also great (Shealy's Palmetto Pig etc.) but this one is #1. Their hash is by far the best I've ever eaten. My family makes special trips an hour away just to pick up from here.
0,The food and service were excellent. Â Best Tex-Mex outside of Texas. Everything about this meal was perfect. Â From the delicious chips and salsa to the entrees. Â I'm not a fan of food made spicy for the sake of being hot. Â Both of the salsas and the queso had a spicy flavor without being hot. One of the highlights was the three Shiner beers on tap: Bock 102 and the Ruby Red. Â All fresh and cold and only $5 for 20 oz. We had two entrees: the barbacoa special and the enchiladas. Â I've never had better. Â Usually enchiladas are just a mess of cheese and a sauce. Â These were flavorful and bite after bite you could taste the distinctive flavors.
0,I love the Hippo. A local free art/food/entertainment liberal weekly paper that covers southern New Hampshire. I like that it offers the arts and I can find out about concerts and new restaurants in the area. Its not very gay or have many gay establishments advertised. That kinda sucks but again I like how it connects me to my not so gay community here in Southern NH.
0,Its such a fun place! with GIANT TV screens all around and so much activity every night of the week and even at lunch hour this is such a fun place to check out. Beware however its really tough to get a seat on game night. the food is pretty good Â - way above regular bar food. The sliders are terrific and the wings are voted one of the best in the city and they are pretty great!! I hear you're able to connect your iPod in to one of the booths and listen to your own music - need to try next. If you're a sports fan - you'll be coming back here again and again!
0,Ok if you are looking for something that screams Richmond check out Plaza Bowl on a Friday night. Â They have pool tables live local bands playing on a stage set up in the center of the alley cheap pitchers of beer and of course duckpin bowling. Duckpin bowling is apparently a dying sport... unlike regular bowling duckpin has more pins and smaller balls. Oh also you get three balls for each turn. Â You need all three though- those pins are small and hard to hit! Â There are only a few alleys left in the United States that have duckpin bowling and apparently Plaza Bowl was about to close when a heroic local citizen stepped in and saved it. Â He is now trying to renovate it little by little so he asks that you do your part by not trashing the bathroom and paying a cover charge to get in
1,On a Sunday Night at 7pm with a restaurant only half full should not result in a 2-hour meal no matter how fabulous the owners think they are. It took 15 minutes just to get a waiter to take our drink order. Another 15 and he was back with the drinks and took our food order. PATHETIC! $32.00 for a 6oz piece of RARE Salmon & $39.00 for 5 12-15 count shrimp with 5 pieces of fettucini is just idiotic. You first have to become a 3-Star venue let alone 4 or 5 to be charging these prices. Definitely not the type of place that should be associated with Hard Rock.
0,Can't comment on wine alright so cut me some slack. Â But seriously folks I was looking for a specific beer LA-31 Grenade and darned if Sidney's didn't have it. Â Not only that they poured it in a cup for me so I could drink it. Furthermore they had some old-ass Russian vodka sold in a bottle shaped like a rifle! Â Guns and booze! What's cooler than that. This place is the shizz yo. Â They have mad beer and stuff. Â GYATTP. BT out....
0,Please note: Â The review is not a review of their beer or their company. Â It's a review of the brewery tour. Â I love their beer and the company. Dear St. Arnold's: It has finally happened. Â You've gotten too big and too popular to conduct the tours the way you used to at least on Saturdays. Â The place is so crowded that the A/C can't keep up. Â Getting a sample requires standing in a line that's nearly back to the entrace. Â People are set up on blankets all over the place making it hard to walk around. Â It's not your fault per se but it does mean that a little more structure is going to be required before I'll go back on a Saturday. I have been on brewery tours all over the country - Miller A/B Leinenkugel's Henry Weinhard's... this is the only one that's basically controlled (and 
0,After visiting the Crown Hill Cemetery my friend and I went to see Inception at this movie theatre. Â Matinee prices were fair the place was not full (probably due to the Brickyard 400 qualifying events in town??) temperature was just right and popcorn was fresh. Â  Since this theatre is less than 10 minutes from my home I'll be back.
0,My favorite part of this restaurant is in the summer- great for hangout in the back deck. Â My husband really likes to watch the planes land. Â The food is okay. Â I got the Salmon and it was not presentable at all- alittle pricey. Â  Staff is friendly and service fast.
0,This high-rise hotel is about 3 blocks from nasty Bourbon St. Â Hilton hired the best valets I've ever experienced. The doorman must have been Houdini in another life - Â he packed the car trunk that well. Â Check-in & out was seamless and the room price was very good for an urban property. Â The room was HUGE even by American standards. Â  I'd definitely return here assuming anyone can provide at least one intelligent reason to return to the City of Lost Souls.
0,"I forgot when Cheesefake factory turned from a family style restaurant into a snooty upscale"" italian style restaurant. Whenever it was it was a day that will forever be labeled as a catastrophic error in strategy. Your business model is not impressive. You way overcharge for food thats quality is essentially macorni grill and you are the baker's square of cheesecake. That means you should be somewhere in those caliber of dining establishments. Prices and light fixtures are unable to convince me otherwise."""
0,All im going to say is OMG.. So beautiful.. Such detail in everything... Â From the floors to the ceilings.. The tour was excellent. Â The tour guide was very good. All the people working there are very friendly. The views from the hilltop overlooking the bay are amazing.. I would definitely recommend this to anyone driving up there. FYI...only thing its not really that good for elderly folk.. Â Too many stairs to enjoy it all.
0,Cheap gambling cheap table games...this is place you go to learn without busting a nut i mean busting your wallet while learning how to play... Not only that but besides driving further down to downtown this is place has the cheapest coronas and heinekens at $2 a pop and cheap and pretty decent food for when your broke. They also have a Subway... Oh and now they have this lounge act in the back and oh my god... Think of its a section of the back part of the building were they have a little stage and they have this one man band guy singing... guy was pretty cool and was all into his act... You need to check this out!!!
0,"The thing with El Charro - is that I am giving it a 2-star review and yet I continue to go back. Â I know it's not great food... but something still draws me in. The thing I love about El Charro - is the soft taco shells and their deep-fried puffy goodness. Â I know they are bad for me but they taste so good - I am even one of the freak-shows who orders the fondue at El Charro's just so I can get a basket of the soft taco sticks. That said I don't think I am ever really happy with or wow""ed by anything I order here. Â The burritos and enchiladas are pretty flavorless... as is the taco meat that they use. Â The entrees come with salad or cheese nachos - Â the cheese nachos consisting of 4 of the chips that are already complimentary that have melted cheese and 1 jalapeno on each. Â Go with the"""
0,Boasts international flavors. Â Started with the cheese ans sausage soup topped with a few kernels of popcorn. Â Interesting touch and complimentry flavors. Â Light soup not heavy cheesy. Â Also ordered the falafels which came atop salad with a light tangy yogurt dressing. Â The spices in the dense falafels were superb. Â I like my falafels more dense and meat-like and this was right on. Â Didn't taste too fried or cornmealy. The tab came with a dark chocolate truffle bite. Â Mmmmm. Â Before I give more than 3 stars i'd need to try dinner.
0,Brother Sebastian's offers a unique perspective on a steak house. And with menu items like frog's legs and baked alaska it definitely keeps you guessing. Unfortunately I wasn't overly impressed with the quality of the food. And because that's one of the main requirements for me to repeat-visit a restaurant I probably won't be going back on my own accord. Still it's a classic local steak house that's worth a try at least. Â Everyone's taste is obviously a little bit different the over 60 crowd that was a majority of the clientÃ¨le while we dined seemed to be big fans.
0,Still fast food but tasty and a variety of options for your diet or personal preferences. Â I tend to sway towards their veggie options as they're more unique that what you find at a regular sandwich shop. Agree with the previous recommendation on the kids meals -- they kind of suck. Â You're better off buying a regular sized (kid friendly) sandwich like the Elvis then cutting it in portions. Staff is always extremely friendly & seems to enjoy working there. Â You can sign up on their website for coupons free birthday meals etc. Not a bad option if you're in the Cool Springs area and want a quick & simple meal.
0,I went here after a gallery opening prepared to be impressed since everyone in the crowd of us who were going had raved about the French food served here. What I ate was tastey though not necessarily up to the par the prices would indicate you would be getting for quality. It seemed more that you were paying for the atmosphere of the joint and the fact that you could see and be seen. For the price you pay for a simple soup and sandwich I'm not entirely convinced this place is worth a return visit--though as I said the food was tastey enough.
0,I love wine and Cru by far has decent selection and it's walking distance from our door so that's quite convenient. I think it would be unfair to compare it to the places we've been in Sonoma and San Francisco so I'm not going in that direction. This is how I think a wine bar should be in terms of atmosphere and simplicity. We don't really eat dinner here but we get a charcuterie a flight of sparkling wine or any reds and then the fondue dessert. I love it that it's such a nice simple spot and has a lot of outdoor seating. Â If I'm not careful I can really splurge in the place so I try to keep it to flights so I can at least have some variety in my vino drinking. The managers always come around to check on you and the service is really great. There is brunch here and that's something I am
0,Decent basic airport bar. Be patient with the bartenders!! They take food orders and have to walk next door to make the orders and pick them up!!
1,For a luxury hotel and resort according to their website and the history that surrounds this property I was sincerely underwhelmed by experience. Â Upon my arrival at the hotel I stood in line for slightly less than one hour to check-in to the resort on a Sunday. Â If you have as many rooms as you have as a resort and are a luxury property then you should learn to staff your property appropriately and potentially add more space for check-in and check-out at the front desk. Â After waiting the excruciatingly long time to check-in I went to my room in the 'Chateau' building on the 6th Floor. The room was also underwhelming again on the premise that you are a luxury resort. Â The room was great if you were the Marriott or a Hilton property and just barely on par with a Westin hotel. Â But
0,Today I had lunch alone. At a buffet. Talk about a surreal experience... and while I wasn't the only one sitting alone reading for some reason it seemed weirder at a buffet than just eating alone and reading at a restaurant. Anyway... on the the food. Seemed necessary to sample a little bit of everything so I tried no less than probably 30 items - mind you in small proportion. But believe the hype here because it was all good. And if you're not into buffet dining then obviously why would you consider coming here to begin with... So if you're on board for grubbing they have four lines with salad bar/dessert Mongolian grill entrees and appetizers galore. Turnover was good on items everything was fresh and hot staff were friendly the place was very clean and my solo buffet lunch was l
0,Nice old home to have a cozy and tasty lunch or dinner. Good tapas selection along with some sandwiches salads and mains. These preparation seems to be good and the ingredients top-notch. A great example would be the Fevere Bread from around the corner. The staff is super-nice... so even if you are a picky fool like me you'll probably be treated to a smile nontheless.
0,For the neighborhood Mainelli's is as good as you'll get. When I came I thought the food was good but half of my party disagreed. The problem we all saw with Mainellis was that you'll spend as much here as you would at a Federal Hill joint like Joe Marzilli's Old Canteen ($20 for a 5 course meal) but the setting is more like Pizza Hut. I thought the spaghetti and meatballs were good. The balls were light and fluffy and the sauce was delicious. The portion was tiny though. Calamari came with about 10 rings and weren't anything to write home about. Eggplant ricotta cheese thing was delicious and our Caesar salads had a delicious buttery Caesar dressing. Pan seared scrod was served to the 96 year old at our table and she loved it. The food is good enough and I'd love to say more to keep t
0,One last update: Â I decided to try one of their shakes today because I was looking for something cool to drink. Â In retrospect I really should have seen this coming but my chocolate banana protein shake didn't taste like chocolate or banana but rather protein. Â And not fun protein but the ground up stuff that they sell in those massive jugs at GNC or at the protein shop thing in the restaurant itself. Basically I've had it with this place. Â The food isn't that great their nutritional info can only be ascertained via the brochure (and isn't all that appealing for what seems to be a healthy living place) and there's a GNC-like place in it which I find disconcerting. Â Blech. Â  The service isn't too bad which may be the only redeeming factor but there are much better places for food
0,Read all the reviews on Yelp and decided to come here for breakfast on a Saturday. Â There was no wait for a table and we were able to order right away. The coffee is great! Â I was actually kind of shocked by how good it was. Â Hash browns were right on the money. Â  Cheap fast and good. Â They all add up to a great Saturday morning breakfast!!
0,This place isn't fancy but it is fun and you will like it. Â I'd give it an easy four stars but I'm offended by the prices. Â Of course there really aren't any other options for good BBQ around are there? Â I have never had such juicy flavorful fried chicken. You should definitely try it if you like southern food but be prepared for sticker shock when you read the menu. You'll forget about the prices briefly because you'll enjoy the food but afterwards you'll wonder if Bubba realizes being an NFL lineman nets a different salary than a Lorain County restaurant owner.
0,I booked this hotel on Hotwire for about $90 and had to book it the night before. Â Pretty good value given it was right next to the airport and had a very good breakfast. Â The room was a very good size and comfortable. Â The hotel was under some kind of renovation which caused paint fumes to be in the hallways. Â They really should warn you of this before you go. Â  The internet was very fast and free which I really appreciated. Â Always love that in basic hotels when the very expensive hotels charge you. Â The people were very nice and accommodating. In room amenities were good with a microwave fridge and nice HD TV. Â I did not order a special room so I am assuming this is the standard room. Â  Overall I would stay here again. Â I would not shout from the mountain tops how great it is but good
1,OK 4 stars because we had fun here. Â The food was tasty but not memorable. Â The drinks were awesome and the waitress added to the festivities. Â This is a great place to go for dinner because you're in San Antonio for a convention you want to eat by the river and you want to have a good time.
0,I've always loved the convenience service and style of CB so with our wedding approaching it was a given that my Fiance and I would register for gifts there. Recently I got a lovely phone call to inform me that someone had (very generously) purchased us the dining room table that we requested. Â We scheduled a delivery time on a Sunday (how convenient!) and waited for our new arrival. Â When the scheduled time came we were surprised to get a call informing us that the truck our table was on and all of its contents had been stolen! I was told that someone would call me later in the day to schedule another delivery. 48 hours later when I hadn't heard anything I called CB to inquire of our status. Â A lovely woman was so apologetic and helped me to schedule a new delivery for the very 
1,So after a great night of drinking at the Brewer's Festival the night before we wanted a nice breakfast and am so glad we ended up here. First I have to say it is no average breakfast place but a upscale place focusing on local and organic offerings. I also really like the fact that they go out of their way to reduce their waste and don't understand why more restaurants don't do it. I had the oatmeal pancakes with bacon homefries eggs and sourdough toast. I had never had an oatmeal pancake before and don't know how I missed them all this time. While it felt like it weighed a ton it actually was very fluffy and flavorful while not being nearly as filling as you would expect. I would say one oatmeal one is equivalent to eating two regular pancakes. The bacon and eggs were actually done as
0,$5 pizzas....through a drive through window? Â What's not to love. Â Yes it's crappy pizza but when it comes time to feed a family of five like mine nothing gets it done quicker and cheaper than Little Ceasars. Â I'm in and out within minutes and two hot pies fills up five hungry mouths for $10 and some change. Â Can't beat it!
0,Been to Cindi's a couple of times for breakfast which has always been a solid experience. The place can get busy though which results in a crazy parking lot and possible long wait for a table. Who can blame em though. Order a pastry or a cookie from the deli case if you feel like you are going to gnaw your arm off. Last night we ventured to Cindi's for dinner. Good crowd but not crowded. I saw chicken fried chicken as a special for the night and indulged myself. My first thoughts were soup since I'm sick and wanted something throat soothing but who says a deep fried chicken breast won't slide down a constantly parched throat? Well it's got cream gravy on it at least! Mashed potatoes and fried okra as sides. Food was tasty although potatoes were slightly off. They might be made from fla
0,Rain Shadow Meats? *sigh* ..Taylor Shellfish? *sniff* Calf and the Kidd? *trembly lip* Sitka & Spruce? Homegrown? Still Liquor?! *sobs* I WANT ALL THE THINGS!!! This place is jam packed full of awesome and I lament not having a never ending supply of cash to buy all the wondrous things to be found here. The building is great -- open feel to everything lots of natural light and full of friendly employees. Â Oh and it is all local and sustainable to boot? Fabulous. *sniffle* Melrose has it all and I want all of it.
0,Strange place. jam packed with anything you would need for a dog but got just an odd vibe overall. The discount card they offer is a little ridic though. for every 250$ you spend you get 10$ back...we are a no frills dog family...
0,The popcorn here is delicious! There are so many flavors including blue raspberry cinnamon vanilla (so good! not too sweet either!) caramel apple even dill pickle. Some may sound strange but you can sample them first. For the more traditional the cheddar and movie theatre butter is fantastic. The owner Kathy is also very nice and personable. Prices are very reasonable to say the least! A must stop in Downtown Waukesha.
0,I stayed her for business. It was good enough but nothing about it (besides being in Newport) made it stand out. It's not too big staff is friendly parking is expensive ($25) and it's situated right on the water which is nice. Didn't try the restaurants but the food provided for the meetings was eh. You don't get the creme de la creme when they have buffet style for lunch/dinner. Rooms are nice but you have to pay for internet which is ridiculous. Gym is good size for a smaller size hotel. Business center is convenient and free...
1,Nothing like visiting the Hawaiian Islands. The Honolulu Airport is always welcoming arriving or departing they seem to have things smoothly in control Hawaii Style. There are beautiful Garden areas and an open air feeling throughout. I noticed their overdue construction / renovations in the old terminal. Local restaurants shops and amenities are located throughout. You can plainly tell that the airline restaurant employees and airport support staff live in paradise they seem happy & helpful. The airport only gets 4 stars due to the fact that you still have to pass through the Scrutiny of Airport Security.
0,This was a great place I would come here every year when I was in Baltimore. The downside to only coming once a year is you don't know when your favorite place to eat in inner harbor has been torn down to make way for a parking garage. Yep it's gone...
1,Food is ok but really doesn't have much flavor. Staff was friendly and price is reasonable.
0,I stumbled into Bosco's for a quick late-night dinner and a beer. The beer wasn't bad. I tried an IPA which had a good fresh flavor without blowing the doors off with the hops. The food honestly was pretty weak. I had a salad and the cedar plank salmon. The lettuce or the weeds in this case tasted like it wasn't washed. The salad consisted of a non-iceberg non-romaine leaf lettuce. Maybe it was spinach? Whatever it was it wasn't very good. The toppings on the salad included a pile of julienned carrots. That was it. My salmon was the best thing that I ate however the portion was small. The salmon had a good fresh (although I'm sure it was frozen) flavor and a sweet asian style sauce with made it tasty. The sides were pretty much a waste of space. Asparagus drenched in butter that I ne
0,This is our favorite weekend lunch buffet and we drive up at least once per month. It is way better than the downtown location (which is closer to our home). The food downtown is completely BLAND! This buffet isn't overly spicy but just enough to be flavorful. The buffet food is Punjab style. On the cold bar are 3 desserts (Gulab Jamun balls Kheer rice pudding and mango fruit cocktail pudding stuff usually) 4-6 chutneys/pickles/sauces and salad/lettuce items. There is sometimes variation like a carrot dessert or a different chutney. The hot bar tends to vary week to week...there is generally always 4+ veggie dishes 2+ chicken dishes some Biryani and lamb or goat. Â  This past weekend I really enjoyed the Vegi Krahi (thinner yellow sauce) and they had my favorite Saag Paneer up the
0,I came in here because I live across the street. After a night of not being able to swallow I needed medical help. First of all everyone was friendly. But there was just something that didn't feel right about this place. Maybe I'm naive about medical clinics but it seemed pretty half assed. I come in with a cold/strep throat and my lungs were not even checked out. Even though I explained I felt congested in them. The doctor spent maybe 2 minutes with me and then has a nursing assistant give me a shot. That's no big deal you may say. But when the frickin' receptionist has to come in and show her how to give the shot that's when we have problems. I'll admit it I've never had good luck with people giving me shots and I'm a baby when I see needles. But nothing puts the fear in you quite l
1,kind of took forever but the pizza was okay. Not my favorite but the waitress was nice and we were seated right away.
0,Not sure where to start on this one folks. Sambuca...the name itself oozes cool just like the liquor it's named for. Â This Sambuca however um...uh...uh... Dark cool colors and cool light fixtures and a super industrial feel set the tone upon one's arrival. Â The place hums and buzzes with life and energy. Â The thing is there's music. Â LOUD music. Â If you don't come expecting it it's a bit of a shock. But that's NBDeal I'm adaptable. Â So there's music...it's loud...so what? Â You may just have a less than conversational dinner which is sometimes okay too. Â Again adaptable. Wine list. Â Here's where I go sour. Â 15 dollars for a glass of Rodney Strong? Â Oh man oh man ohhh no you didn't. Â I hate hate HATE overpriced wine lists *especially* when they're less than stellar (& that's me be
1,I'm not a fried chicken eater. But I stopped here for lunch and I ordered the Deep fried breaded Chicken Chunks and oh my they were delicious. I also had a small cole slaw that was perfect..
0,Would have been 4 stars but the parking at this location is tiny. Three stalls and one handicapped one. This is a pull out along Sorrento Valley Blvd. where you can park and eat lunch or take a short hike up the hill and get a great view of the Los Penasquitos Valley below. No official access to the Los Penasquitos Preserve from this location but plenty of well-worn ruts down into the valley. Try something different for lunch if you work nearby and get out of the office for that hour.
0,Loooove it. SoKo jjimjilbang at its best. If any Busan people are reading this think: the facilities of Spa Land in Haeundae crammed into a smaller building that's open 24/7! Would recommend this to anyone looking to relax!
1,This place gets 1 star because their lovely hostess working on 5/8/10 at 11:15 AM tried to seat me in the worst dark corner table she could find. Â Please note that there were many other tables available. I don't accept rudeness to female travelers merci mille fois!
1,Easy company to buy or sell your coins to. Â Kenny is one of the nicest people i've had the chance to work with and he always makes sure your transaction goes through without a hitch. Â I just sold 10 of our pieces for a nice 70% profit since we'd had them since 2004. Â My husband appreciates all the updates we get too! Â Bravo.
0,Two-story target in Nicollet mall. 'nuff said! It's very well-organized here. The flow of the store makes sense. Staff are friendly and the store itself is very clean. Â  I'm going to stay in downtown MSP everytime so I can be close to this Target :)
0,Day drinkers let us unite at Panini's! I'm totally kidding... I mean I only day-drink on the weekends. I swear. But when I do Panini's is one place I love to park my tushy and sip some cold brews. Like few other places on W 6th this spot is a wonderful daytime get-away from the scenesters. No pompous menu here folks just hearty pieces of hot New York style pizza and huge signature sandwiches loaded with fries. Don't come here for fancy cocktails or they'll probably laugh at you. Scoot up to the bar and grab a cold beer or a mixed drink. Be happy. This is also a pretty chill place to watch college football on Saturday afternoons... or just the Buckeyes. Seriously have a few drinks eat a huge Panini's sandwich watch the game and live the good life. P.S. It's the perfect solution to 
0,A little pricey yes though it seems like the beer prices are comparable to the rest of the city (4.50-4.75 for most beers including Becks). That being said the service is really good even during something as wacky as a trivia night and the fries are incredibly cool. Â they're like potato disks fried up as fries (oh wait that's exactly what they are). Â But they're good something that can be hard to find fry-wise in a city of McDonalds-like fry waste. Â On top of that the small bacon-bleu burgers are really good as well. Overall a decent place to food and a brew after a long day and do something like trivia.
0,Okay wtf why didn't I know Lollicup was here? I thought I would never again find a coconut milk tea like the first bubble tea I ever had at a street fair in NYC...but I am 99% certain it has just been found. Except for exploding it all over the place. I felt like a total idiot but the guy made me a new one even though it wasn't that much that spilled out. It was just as good and the boba were absolutely perfect. My jaw can be a complete pain in the ass sometimes so if I can have bubble tea without popping my jaw out of place I am more than happy. I just had the lemon black tea making that two days in a row with bubble tea and my jaw doesn't hurt. PERFECT. I have a feeling my little card will be full before it's September. I'm not a fan of frozen bubble tea but I am pretty tempted by
1,I was glad to see that they had sorted the teething problems on my recent visit. The monorail had just opened on my last visit to Vegas and one of the wheels on one of the trains had fallen off within few days! I had chosen to base myself at the cheaper Stratosphere because the monorail was available to whisk me to more glamorous locations on the Strip! With the brutal Vegas traffic I don't really trust travelling up and the Strip in cars/buses as I've almost been late for various shows/appointments before due to the traffic. The monorail was running well and efficiently on my recent visit - 6 minutes between trains. The trains were nicely air conditioned though not the stations. The stations were clean and felt safe but could be quite deserted at night times. There were enough ticket mac
0,This is in the old Homemakers store next to the Expo. I'm not sure what to call it. Ultra modern Lots of color which I like. But way to much acrylic formica and the furniture really doesn't seem to be that well made. They price reflects the style not the quality.
0,The wife and I were looking for a restaurant to spend our 10-year wedding anniversary at. Â I know my wife likes to eat a nice restaurants so I decided to pick one that servers the best steak in Cleveland. Â We made our reservations and off we went. Upon arrival we were quickly seated in the darkly lit Red The Steakhouse. Â It was a little hard to find though. Â It's in a business district and apparently is the other half of Moxie The Restaurant. Â If you're driving here look for a Moxie sign not a Red sign. Â The door is hidden good luck finding it. Â I found it right away but it doesn't look like an entrance. We started off with tap water and a bottle of Cabernet. Â Then we ordered appetizers - onion soup for the wife and the House Red salad for me. Â My wife said the onion soup was 'over 
0,I just gobbled down a cheddar roast beef and fries in less than 5 minutes. Do I really need to say anything else? I was NEVER a huge roast beef fan until my boyfriend persuaded me to try Lion's Choice. After I finished making fun of the name (because REALLY...what kind of name is Lion's Choice?) I tried a bite of his roast beef. And I've been a fan ever since. WOWEE. Their fries are absolutely delish as well. I'm too nervous to try anything else on the menu (pulled pork from a drive-thru fast food place? No thanks.) so I'm sticking to what I know...for now. I hiiiiighly recommend!
0,Mediocre lasagna and ok service. Â Just because you are in Vegas doesn't mean that you are catering to the McDonalds crowd. Â The lasagna sauce was sweet and even a ton of salt couldn't kill that sweetness. Â When I cut into my small piece of lasagna it was dry inside very dry. Â While I give them kudos because it was obviously made in-house I expected to have my socks knocked off for a $20 piece of pasta. Â Our group were barely able to squeeze into the small space they allocated for us and that set us up for a hot loud time. It wasn't a memorable time or food I won't be back.
0,It's hard for me to rate Kitaro because I feel like if it was closer to the city I might feel a little a little less enthusiastic it being around tons of phenomenal restaurants and all... but I'm so glad O'Fallon has a place like this among all of the chains and so-so dinner spots. The building itself is really pretty and has lights that change color and look amazing at night and the interior is large and looks like a typical Asian joint. One thing I have to comment on it the cocktails of course... so good! I love when I can ignore the drink list and ask for a peach martini and it's set in front of me without a problem. The service has always been pretty good in my experience both at the bar and in the dining area. Kitaro is loaded with appetizers ranging from crab & artichoke dip to c
0,Grilled Veggie Sandwich. Wild Mushroom Linguinie. Â Tuna Tartine. All Yummy. Much better additions to what is actually an addition to Turtle Bread. I have yet to eat here for dinner but am anxiously awaiting my next evening dining experience as my in-laws have highly recommended it. The menu changes regularly and they always focus on integrating fresh and local ingredients which is almost becoming standard practice around town. Because this is located in stroller land it's a super kid-friendly allowing all of us parents with little ones in tow an opportunity to eat healthy delicious food without the fear of dirty looks (and yes i used to be one of those people and let me tell ya karma is a bitch so for all of you out there who may procreate one day you may find yourself in the sam
0,I've had two positive experiences with this Dairy Queen one quite recent so I guess that should warrant a FTR. Â :) Â  Â  Being right next door to Discount Tire if you are having your car worked on and have a minor hunger of any type this is the natural choice cause you can walk about 30 paces and there you are. Â  I'm a fan of Dairy Queen tacos as while they are a total abomination of the word taco in relation to what the Mexican original is they do call them Texas Tacos which is about as Tex Mex as you can get. Â  A crunchy yellow corn shell (never seen in Mexico) meat seasoned with a little garlic (which is not an ingredient in any Mexican food) and American previously frozen shredded orange cheese from a giant wholesale bag. Â  Now that is an American taco my friend. Â  No pretense. Â An
0,We stopped in here on the way to our hunting cabin. Â We did not have food but it looked like standard bar fair. Â The bartender was not very friendly and immediately asked for our ID's. Â I prefer to be welcomed to a place and maybe at least ask how we are doing?! Â They don't have tap beer and they also do not have Sandcreek which is brewed right down the road in Black River Falls. Â They did have a bucket of 6 shorties for $6 so that was interesting. Â For what is around here this place seemed alright. Â If we go back to hunt in that area again I can see spening a bit more time there. Â It would also be interesting to see this place when it was not in the middle of hunting season.
0,I usually come here during the week and after 6pm. There are always people running in and out but I can always find a place to sit. Service is good and the baristas are quick and efficient. This location is pretty small.
0,I think I've figured out why everyone in town is so upset with this company and our newly installed parking meters... they're really good at their job and we're not used to stuff like that. Trash pick-up is done by about a dozen or so people and they only work once a week. No one can seem to figure out anyone's water bill and even begging won't get them to dispatch someone to your property. Are you trying to tell me that not only do I have to pay to park on a city street but if I don't someone is going to write me a ticket?! YEAH RIGHT! This is Atlanta. We don't pay to park on the street. I once left my car parked in front of a meter on 11th St. and forgot about it for almost 3 days. I remembered where I left it when I woke up for work on Monday and it was still there. No tickets. No boot
0,This store is lovely. Â But fuck it's expensive. Â I've been wanting to get personal stationery but I can't see spending a minimum of $300 for 100 cards/envelopes (the small ones) - I only want to show off a little you know give that impression that I'm on it. Â Organized. Â Writing thank you notes is just part of my daily routine. Â But no for that price I'd hesitate to thank anyone in writing. Â I'd save the really good paper for those thank-you emergencies - not healthy. I would recommed the store for stampers and scrapbookers. Â I'd even recommend it for people who want high-quality and creative business cards and stationery and can afford to shell out serious green for that sort of trifle. Â It's a wonderful alternative to Hallmark for basic cards and very pretty. Â I'm just not girly eno
0,This body shop did a fantastic job with my 09 Challenger after it had been maliciously vandalized. Â I took it to this shop due to all the shops here in the Phoenix area being booked solid until March of next year (thanks to a whopping hail storm that hit the valley) and these guys were able to get it right in. They did a fantastic job on the paint and it looks like new! Â I am thrilled with this shop and would recommend them to anyone who is looking for a good body shop. Â (And yes I am picky but these guys really did do good work. And got it right the first time.)
0,Good enough and close enough to frequent in an area with a lack of Asian choices. My boyfriend and I have been going more often with craving for milk tea. They probably have the best in the area (if there is better PLEASE tell me!) But my most recent stop the cashier pulled the tea out of the fridge already prepared with the boba in it. I didn't complain - but it resulted in harder less chewy boba. Sad face. But the tea flavor is strong with a good milk balance - so until they severely wrong me- I'd probably go again. My most recent meal here I got the grilled pork chops. The menu warns they take extra time when I ordered them the server warned me that it would take extra time and then in the end- they came out the same time as my boyfriends pho. Hmm I should have known something w
0,San Francisco is where I gain most of my winter weight... er summer weight this time around. And when the hotel gym just won't do there's the Dailey Method. We had a good mile walk over to the SOMA location which is another plus. We arrived already warmed up but Pete was sure to keep our temperature and heart rate going so when our 7am class started the marching began. It was a smaller class which can be a good and bad thing. Good thing that the instructor can pay more attention to your movements; bad thing that well the instructor can keep paying attention to your movements ... and call you out. Okay that's a good thing.

0,Steve and Barry's is an amazing store. It features clothing lines by Sarah Jessica Parker Venus Williams and Amanda Bynes. There are women's men's and children's sections that feature everything from professional career wear to college and casual apparel. Steve and Barry's went bankrupt earlier this year so about 100 of their stores are closing. This is a great excuse to go to any of the stores now because they are having a closing sale and many of the items are under $10. I really like Sarah Jessica Parker's line Bitten. I got a hounds tooth long wool coat there for $30 (!) which would probably be more like $50 or even $80 at higher end department stores. It's really warm and I'm so glad I was able to find a more formal coat for an affordable price. I also get a lot of my work sla
0,Alittle pricey but they are always available for emergencies. Â My dog hurt his paw and I came here on a Saturday night which there was not a long wait. Â Staff was super friendly and attentative. Â  Veterinarian was very friendly and caring.
0,First off - service (since that's very important to me!): Not bad not good. Â Friendly but not too attentive. Condition - The place has a beautiful calm & clean feeling to it. Â Some slight modern touches to it huge bamboo sticks line some of the walls. A waterfall wall faces the entry-way. It's a small restaurant (I'd estimate at about 20 x 50 ft wide) and during the hour I went (lunch) it was SUPER quiet. Â Anyone from across the room could have easily heard my conversation if they tried. Food - This is where I was least satisfied. Â So it's not terrible food at all. I had the Pho - not too bad. Â I also tried the pad thai but wasn't impressed. Â  I would go here again if a friend wanted and asked me to but I would not recommend it to anyone.

1,What can i say that hasnt already been said...probably a lot but ya. Pretty good food decent priced nice decor and the wait staff has always been good. Interior I especially like. Â Its red oak mohaganny color if that makes sense plus its kinda dark. Â It just makes you feel nice and cozy like if you were at a real steak house. Almost to that notch Mr. V's almost. Â Plus just found out today that the same owner who owns the Tam's Burger chains is the owner here. How does this come into play? Yes it doesn't!

1,I've been on the tour 3 times now. Â This past weekend my husband & I were being tourists in our own town and decided to go on the tour as he had never been. Â For $15 a person it is not a bad priced tour at all. Â We did find out that there is a later 21+ tour that starts at 8pm. Â This is a little more raunchier and includes a drink. Â They need to advertise this tour on their site. Â We had no idea about it and thought 5pm was the last tour time. Â We will definitely be back for the 8pm tour. They do take credit cards now. Â I recommend getting your tickets at least an hour early to make sure you get on the next tour. Â While you're waiting head into the lounge for a drink. The bloody mary's are awesome!
1,Good food at a great price. Â Went here after a day at Sea World with my husband brother and sister in law. Â I had the taco and tortilla soup from the choose 2 menu. Â The meal came with beans and rice. Â The free chips and salsa when we sat down helped to tide us over until we chose what we wanted for dinner. Â Both my husband & I got the grande margaritas. Â Word of advice...they are definitely big! Â My on the rocks margarita was a little watered down. Â Husband had the swirl with sangria and he said it was very tasty. Â Caught a peek at their happy hour menu and it looked pretty good. Â I would suggest calling ahead to put your name on the list. Â On a Tuesday night about 6:30 we had to wait about 25 minutes for a table.
1,I am on a huge mission to find good and authentic Mexican food here in Miami. Â  We have heard this place is pretty authentic and decided to head out to Calle 8 for good eats! Â  They have parking in the back for patrons which is great since otherwise it is metered out on the street. Â We got there at an odd hour so it was not busy at all and that was a huge plus because we were famished. Immediately chips and a salsa were brought out. Â The salsa was really sauce.. hot sauce not what us gringos think of as salsa (chopped Tomatoes Onion Cilantro & Jalapeno) - Gringo salsa came on the dishes.. very nice. Â  There were three of us mulling over the menu and had such a hard time trying to decide. Â A good sign is that they had Tortas Milanesas Chilaquiles Sopes and Gorditas. Â Only truly authent

Â I know that sounds really funny about a Winners but if you're ever in Toronto check out the Winners on Bloor St or the one on Yonge and College and you'll know what I mean. Â The one in Montreal is also a lot better than the Winners that Ottawa has to offer. They do carry the usual mens young mens kids womens shoes jewelery but you will find really high end merchandise at the other 3 locations in MTL and TO.
0,Congratulations Richard. I don't give many 5 *s out. Krista A has narrowed it down perfectly. Went here today after calling ahead to make appointment. Met with Richard and he made the process painless and easy. Had a 1 PM appointment and Richard was ready and waiting for me. A quick review of last year's 1040 since I was a new client and we were on our way. About a half hour and the taxes were filed electronically. Charged me $77 which was a great deal - doing them online myself was $87 with a discount using TurboTax. Pros: Personable electronic filing takes cash check or credit card for fees. Honest and upfront. Treats you with respect and is willing to both shoot the breeze and make sure the necessary paperwork is completed. Final work is presented in a nice green binder which makes f
0,Kind of the old fashioned cramped hardware store that has everything including staff that are very helpful and know what they are talking about. Please note that this is not a home improvement store and I do not think that they carry lumber and drywall.
1,I'm only here because this is where my office booked me. I would rather stay at the Courtyard by Marriott across the street. FREE BREAKFAST FREE INTERNET LARGER ROOMS. Here it's 13.00 a day for Internet and breafast is $20.00
0,A friend told me that the chef who set this up came from the infamous Tayyabs around the corner. I was a little late so didn't have a chance to try much but the currys were reasonably tasty. Cost is reasonable at about 11 per person and everyone satisfied. Definitely a popular place!
1,I went for brunch right when this place opened and was disappointed in the service and the food but i sat upstairs and loved the decoration. Â Under pressure from others who wanted to go i went back for dinner sat at a super uncomfortable table at the bar and loved the service and my food. Â I had the amazing burger that time. Â So I'm not sure where I stand on this place now but I'd probably go back.
0,Stayed here overnight before heading to Napa and it met our needs at a decent price. Comfy beds decent size bathroom but a small room overall. We didn't have a view but didn't really need one given the short amount of time we were there. Location is good with a handful of restaurants within walking distance as well as a post office and Walgreens which is always helpful! The lobby is lovely with a fireplace flat screen TV and wine tastings. We missed the tasting so upon check-in the receptionist sent up some glasses to make up for it which was a nice gesture. Even nicer they brought up two full bottles by mistake which we made sure to enjoy by the fire. All in all Harbor Court is a nice hotel for a quick stay while in San Fran.
0,Oh I know Big Brother is watching me I know they are frothing at the mouth to make sure that I am attracted to the sales bins the food aisles to the numerous other places that contain all of the shit that one would need only to amuse themselves and not live. But unfortunately for Target I go in to get what I need at that moment in time and that's pretty much it. I am not bothered by the behemoth Target I'm not bothered by the corporate employees I'm not bothered by the creepy people. What gets me about this store is the fact that it's uber convenient for me since I am definitely not driving down to the Lake Street target and to be honest the Target in St. Louis Park is full of snobby people that stare at me anyways. It's within walking distance of home for me carries everything (
0,Wow this one really caught me off guard. Usually all the great restaurants are in Chicago but Ashling On the Lough made an exception. The food was simply done right. Aside from the half-hour wait the rest of the experience was phenomenal. The waiter was candid which is great at breaking up the monotony of your typical mundane server. We started with the steak fries and Â Irish curry sauce which was exceptional considering I'm not much of a fan of either. The fries were fresh and the Irish curry sauce embodied everything you love about curry but with a little hint of sweetness to it. I had the fish and chips for my main course. Growing up in Wisconsin you eat a lot of fish fries in your day but this one stands out because the fish is ridiculously fresh and moist. The Smithwick's bat
1,Before they sold out and started franchising the brand I would have rated them 5 stars. However since then they have diluted the brand cheapened the experience and skimped on service so I docked them a star for that. I've always enjoyed going to Fishbone's however bring your Diamond card because they are expensive. Â Granted they are not as expensive as they used to be ($100/plate not even ten years ago) but they are still in the neighborhood of $30+/person). They usually have a live band of a decent caliber performing most evenings. The food is generally acceptable and the service is mediocre now. They do not take reservations though and if you step out of line to go to the bathroom or to get a drink from the bar you lose your place. Overall Â 4 stars.
0,Not only do they perform in DC bet they have a few troupes touring the country seemingly all year long. Â This review is specifically for the group that did the Portsmouth NH shows yesterday but I've seen them enough times that this applies to all Capitol Steps performance. They are brilliant and they make fun of everyone left or right blue or red etc. Â No politician is safe. Â There are endless video clips on YouTube and they are the best commercial that this group could ever wish for. And when you see them sit as close to the stage as you can. Â The facial expressions and the goofy costumes make the show even better.
0,I have been converted. Before last night when I attended the International Supper Club I would have told you I do not like Indian food. I quickly learned Â that it wasn't that I didn't like Indian cuisine I was just eating at the wrong places. I will admit the service started out slow the waiter would take half of our drink order and disappear. Then reappear with the first round and finish taking the rest of the orders. Â Perhaps a dozen Yelpers could be intimidating. Once he started to take the food orders a spark appeared in his personality. He truly seemed to enjoy talking about the entrees and the spice levels of each dish. He issued warnings to some diners and those who did not listen to his wisdom had beads of sweat building up on their upper lip and forehead. My entree was Chicke
0,I did a review for the Silver Spur so I guess I should do one for it's reincarnation. Â For me it's kind of like Voldemort (oh I'm geeking it up alright) in that I try not to say it's name. Â In my mind it is and always will be The Spur. Â If I confuse you by using it's old name well quite frankly that's your problem. I have a deep and everlasting love of the Spur so when it closed I was upset. Â I was happy to hear though that it would be re-opening with different owners. Â Until I heard the name. Â I'm sorry but who names a bar Chainsaw?? Â I digress. Apparently there were some improvements made the country music posters that covered the walls were removed and it was no longer 7-nights-a-week-karaoke. Â Some nights they had live bands. Â I'm honestly not sure if that's still the case a
