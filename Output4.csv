---2eJpQ2HAnRQRp2v7XLA,#NAME?,I came to Chicago on business and was initially supposed to stay downtown; however a colleague recommended this hotel--and I am so glad that they did! The attention to detail and finishing touches in my room are what made this hotel feel like home. Staying in a smaller hotel allowed me to connect with the local Chicago vibe while simultaneously enjoying exquisite service from the staff at a fraction of what it might cost to stay in a Magnificent Mile high-rise. Considering the quality ambiance and charm of this hidden Chicago treasure it made my trip a memorable experience. Not only was I able to secure a bike rental to avoid the high cost of renting a car but I also was directed to some of the local galleries in the West Loop by the friendly staff members.,5,5,9/28/2011,#NAME?,0,2,0

--87QVdPvgbDK3GeVxFRzg,92rtlWxS2aOngzkKhi-OxQ,My family has been using Korean Air for many many years now. Going to Asia Korean Air is one of the lowest priced airlines and yet their service is not compromised. The flight attendants are lovely professional and polite. Check in is good and the meals served are also good. The only thing is that if you have to speak with their customer service line it's quite hard to communicate with their staff. Luckily I have some Korean friends and they have done the talking for us otherwise it couldve been worse. All their baggage policies are the standard international size and weight limitations. I suggest not only with this airline but with all airlines to familiarize yourself with their change cancellation and baggage policies before you commit. Airlines will serve the food their country,4,0,7/28/2012,92rtlWxS2aOngzkKhi-OxQ,43,158,0

Â But since I had watched a cooking show that involved homemade ravioli last night that's what I had my heart set on when we arrived. Â I figured... Italian Restaurant has to have ravioli right? Well long story short they didn't (except for the fried appetizer kind) and I settled for spinach and chicken manicotti. Â But before I got to that I indulged in copious amounts of the complementary never-ending butter-injected bread with marinara sauce. Â Then I opted for a cup of 'roasted onion soup' in lieu of salad (but had salad also since everyone else at the table ordered it and it was served family style).

#NAME?,6PEIKIibsT3NkG1THRfJPg,I have eyed this shop at the Old orchard location and was thrilled to have time to wander into the Evanston shop. First off- let me say the the you girl who was working (short reddish hair glasses and piercings) was incredibly friendly and helpful. Â My mother and I were in the shop close to closing time but that did not deter her from grabbing other merchandise to show us and really helping us! Â She was ab Fab. The pricing is incredibly cheap. Â I picked up a cape/sweater thing for the office for 38$. Â My mother picked up a great sweater to throw on to go shopping etc for the same price. I mean really. Â 38$? Â  The selection of gifts and cards is really cute. Â I am a fan of this place!,4,1,11/20/2011,6PEIKIibsT3NkG1THRfJPg,86,478,0

--C-lbQ1ewqAO2UGhk0Xlw,XYSDrIef7g4Gmp3lNFVO6A,So this was my first Yelp outing... I arrived right around 7:30 pm - a few others were there before me - we had to stand outside for a few minutes - which did not bother me. We had a little room in the back to ourselves. Before ordering we had to negotiate with our server about the fact that several of us needed to have separate checks as we were paying with credit cards - our server tried to make this into a difficult task - but in the end we got what we wanted. I eagerly looked over the menu since I had heard good things about this place. I was disappointed to see that there was no Poki offering on the menu. So I asked anyway - no no Poki. So then I ordered Miso soup Edamame and a variety of rolls and Nigiri sashimi. First I was informed that they were out of Edamame then out of sc,3,4,11/18/2007,XYSDrIef7g4Gmp3lNFVO6A,1388,2530,0
#NAME?,OapLWhQI4_Gm32-nYbHmUA,Not having a sweet tooth not being a non-cupcake aficionado I love Yelp for pointing out little gems like the Hummingbird Bakery. Am I right in saying that cupcakes are an American obsession which is slowly translating itself across the Atlantic and in years to come just like the indigenous red squirrels of today we'll be creating special protected areas to try to stop the humble English custard tart from being wiped out by its more aggressive American cake cousin? From the outside the cute arrangement of the different coloured tarts in the window display made me think it was an art gallery until the words Hummingbird Bakery over the shop triggered the latent Yelp memories. So I told my friend confidently that this was the best cupcake in town according to my knowledgeable Yelp friends,4,2,5/31/2009,OapLWhQI4_Gm32-nYbHmUA,754,1693,0
#NAME?,jO44Apni7iJZVVK4HQ60tA,Ok the wait this time was decent despite a packed house. Â I went at 12:45 so perhaps that made the difference. Â Back to 3 stars. We split a dragon roll Â a spicy salmon roll and a crab salad roll. Â So sue us we were hungry. Â  The eel on the dragon roll was really good this time-- fresh and moist. Â The salmon was fantastic-- really fresh high quality vibrant and buttery. Â Points for drsssing the salmon so it lacked any of those tough stringy things. Â You know what I'm talking about. Â Those things completely ruin a bite of sushi for me. Â The edamame were slightly overcooked. Â Like I said we were hungry. Â  If the quality remains this high consistently they will remain in my good graces. Â And isn't that what everyone wants?,3,0,Update - 12/11/2008,jO44Apni7iJZVVK4HQ60tA,34,166,0

#NAME?,3zxy3LVBV3ttxoYbY4rQ8A,If you think being past out in the backseat of a cab is proof of a kick-ass night well you're wrong. To end the night with a bang you MUST go to Mai's Restaurant for a late night snack (read: feast). It's also a good choice for lunch/casual dinner. Entrees are served family-style (big plates serving spoon) so sharing is encouraged. Top picks: Start off with spring rolls served with mounds of fresh greens (you'll need that extra hydration boozehounds); Vietnamese egg rolls steaming hot crispy goodness with a side of jalepeno-adorned fish sauce; garlic beef (or chicken) infused with soppy sauce veggies and piles of fully-cooked and soft garlic cloves--almost as savory as the meat--and of course fried rice.

#NAME?,XYSDrIef7g4Gmp3lNFVO6A,BJ's recently opened a location over in Virginia Gateway in Gainesville VA. I received an invitation in the mail for a two month trial membership - so I went in to check it out. I had the option of signing up for a year beyond the 2 month trial membership for $40.00. If I waited for the 2 month trial membership to expire and then make a decision on membership - at that point the price would be $50.00 for a year. So I went ahead and signed up for the year - which means I have 14 months for $40.00. Because the place is so new the place looks nice and clean. I went and stocked up on things like bottled water dishwasher detergent and dishwasher drying agent. The one thing I will ding them on is their Membership Services area seemed a little disorganized.

Thank goodness they served us a mini-muffin prior to our order coming out I was hungry! My friend and I went in and let them know we were going to sit outside. They noted they would be right out to service. We waited about 15 minutes. Once we placed our order we had another friend join us about 30 min later and place an order. Our third friend got his breakfast in a matter of 10 minutes. It was over an hour later when they noted they messed up our order (cook staff was looking at tables 1 & 2 vs. our table #12) ....something to that effect.

#NAME?,bTlonpHjT0p7gF8Ex9XlVw,I always get great haircuts here and I have difficult hair. Â The shop is unpretentious and there was no waiting. Â Natilee takes the time necessary to do it right. The only thing that would make Natilee's better for me is if her shop was closer to my office. Â Still the drive is worthwhile. Call to make an appointment and don't be late. Â Natilee runs on-time and works fast. Final thoughts: Â If you don't already know who Steve McQueen was and what he's famous for you might want to brush up on that before you go. Â You'll still get a killer haircut but the conversation will be more interesting if you're conversant about Steve. P.S.

Â In writing this review I realized that places like this exist for funerals. Â It was interesting that the place had 2 funeral parties going on at once. Â It doesn't matter how good the food and the atmosphere are when you are gathering people for a quick funeral meal. Â For that I retract a few of the previous comments. Â The meal was average but it was served by people who really seemed to care that we were happy and enjoying ourselves. Â The the bartenders and waitstaff were incredibly nice. Â The gentlemen at the stale cigarette-smelling bar kept us all happy. The appetizers were deviled eggs and sausage in a brown gravy.

Now after 18 years I still go back every now and then for their gyros and their cheese fries.

#NAME?,NZba-Q-Fp10iF77CTQt24Q,QuikTrip is great for sooo many reasons. * All of their stores are always clean and well lit. * You get greeted when you walk inside. * They take checks (seriously this comes in handy every once-in-a-while). * Gas prices are usually the lowest in town. * All of their fuel products are guaranteed although I'm not really sure what that means. This location is just over the train tracks in Vinings about a mile from I-285. It's usually really busy but you can get in and out easily.

#NAME?,bYENop4BuQepBjM1-BI3fA,The IHOP in my neighborhood closed after 50 years and we kind of miss them for a cheap breakfast. I wish they'd tear down the old building and build us a new one like this location. The inside is more modern but still very compact and tight. They make use of every inch but doing so puts the tables close together. It also makes the table tops small and crowded once your food arrives. However IHOP serves up a good cheap breakfast. Their Breakfast Sampler gives you everything you'd want for your morning meal. You'll enjoy two of everything; eggs your way bacon sausage ham pancakes and a hearty side of hash browns.

We didn't have a view but didn't really need one given the short amount of time we were there. Location is good with a handful of restaurants within walking distance as well as a post office and Walgreens which is always helpful! The lobby is lovely with a fireplace flat screen TV and wine tastings. We missed the tasting so upon check-in the receptionist sent up some glasses to make up for it which was a nice gesture. Even nicer they brought up two full bottles by mistake which we made sure to enjoy by the fire.

The fries were fresh and the Irish curry sauce embodied everything you love about curry but with a little hint of sweetness to it. I had the fish and chips for my main course.

Even just outside their main building they have some seats for people to relax at. Overall just a very quaint yet pristine property. Reif has a very cute wine tasting standing room with a bar area for the educator to stand behind and pour the samplings. I tried a white red and ice wine at Reif and loved them all. Reif Estates was actually my favorite winery on the tour because of their delicious wines. Those I tried I found to be the most sweet and smooth of anywhere which I really liked.

The secret to this place is to order chicken or steak. They have the best marinated meats ever. I think their chicken is marinated in a beer and lime marinade. It is so yummy.

As I approached the Future of Flight building I was getting excited as I saw rows of new aircraft parked up and the enormous Boeing assembly building. The experience consists of a 40 minute tour of the assembly plant and a walk round the museum. The tour started with multiple warnings (to be often repeated) about no electronic equipment. At least there were cheap lockers for rental to leave your stuff in the main building. There were 2 short films in the museum building but these were disappointing.

Â The answer is yes. Youngish guys looking their best to impress young ladies. Â If the boys have no chance they get too drunk and burden their friends and sometimes those around them. Â As for the ladies they too are on the prowl or hanging a little less drunk then their male counterparts.

We had to wait a few minutes when we first arrived as they prepared us a table and had a chance to chat up the manager. She was very friendly and inviting and recommended a few of her favorite dishes. The decor is warm and classic. Very fitting with the food vibe they put out. My ONE complaint is that the music pretty much sucked the entire time. I would have loved some Bossa Nova or jazz. Instead I got Modest Mouse and something that sounded like a bad interpretation of Nine inch Nails. Moving on.... The service was excellent. She was attentive but non-threatening or imposing.

Found a perfect one propped up against the building outside except for two glaringly large problems: (1) It had a price tag of $2600. TWO THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS. For a small rusty iron gate. This just doesn't seem right to me especially considering that an Internet search indicated that similarly-sized ones seem to be going from other salvage places for a third of that price. (2) There was a sign on the door saying that they were closed and wouldn't be reopening until May 14th.

I like to go a couple times to a place before I review it just to be fair. Sure Maxwell's is a rip-off of other restaurants (they have a chocolate cake there that looks as if it's a lesser quality Portillo's clone; I did not order it). But before there was Portillo's there was the the beloved Maxwell Street in Chicago that gave way to University Village and The University of Chicago. They ripped them off first -- but themed restaurants aren't anything new and I wouldn't fault them on that alone. If that were it.

#NAME?,QQuy7MENd5YHFhfLaLtPNw,Redwood Lodge is definately one of my favorite restaurants of all time anywhere!! The food is off the charts and the service is exceptional. They offer unique (house) salads that I have yet to compare to anywhere else in that they use other forms of lettuce and greenery as well as cranberries and nuts and crumbled cheese and other craziness. Â they have the best salads! they microbrew their own beer which has always been an adventure to the palate. Â the beer goes down good so that's a plus! Â They have won several awards for their microbrews so drink up those pints mates! the decor is backwoods lodgey but its not overdone and its not in your face so it is a non issue. the food is to die for and has never disappointed. bring your charge card though because they ARE quite pricey. that's,5,1,8/26/2007,QQuy7MENd5YHFhfLaLtPNw,121,184,0

Irish Car Bomb cake was so good. I like how they use random furniture to give it a very warm cosey feeling. Â We tried a lot of items and everything was good. I was a bit disappointed that they only had one special item left. I agree with a previous writer that the menu does seem very random. We enjoyed everything we ordered but it would be nice to see more of a rotation. It would keep me coming back more often.

#NAME?,f1MFQxTZAWJnRQdrouLg_A,Well...the pizza is good and they have an above average beer list. That's gotta count for something right? I've had this place on my radar for a while simply because I had been told by people in the craft beer circles that this Northland restaurant and bar was aggressively trying to make a name for itself. This always struck me as odd as the name sounds more akin to Showbiz Pizza or Chuck E Cheese than to a beer bar or any place for people over 9. But not wanting to judge a book by it's cover I went along with some friends. I was closer to being correct than I had ever seriously imagined. Walking in the front door the space is divided into what seems to be a main bar and a dining room. Our party was too large to fit into the bar so we were in the dining area.

Walking in i wasn't sure if we just sat down or ordered or what then a very nice guy popped his head out and told us we order with him and he will Â bring it to us easy enough. We had a pulled beef burrito platter and a chicken burrito platter both were AWESOME! A little messy but soooo good. They were quite large so we really could of probably split it for lunch.

A bowl of oatmeal for $6? One egg with toast for $4? That's borderline ridiculous. The oatmeal was great (oatmeal with cinnamon brown sugar cooked apples and raisins... yum!) but not worth the pricetag. It was delicious but the next time I go there I will make sure it's a date where I'm not the one footing the bill. The one really awesome thing that totally surprised me was that you can get a to-go cup of coffee for no extra cost (if you ordered coffee with your meal that is).

The faux rock exterior and sign proclaiming cocktails may set you into the wrong mind set. Alas... there are no male strippers. BUT What a fantastic name for a male strip club! CAN you imagine?? You could have an entire theme going. In fact- the clientele was elderly men chowing down... one was even having a hot toddy at 11:30 on a Tuesday. They brought it immediately when he sat down- his regular order! In fact- a work colleague and I headed in here after a meeting for lunch- kind of hoping that is what we would find... instead we ended up having a late breakfast.

While the wait staff was very friendly and the decor was about what you'd expect for a BBQ joint (country pig-themed) I just couldn't stomach the R&B and rap music. What a huge disappointment. I'm kind of shocked. The only music you hear in restaurants out here is country and of all places country music would fit a BBQ joint. Heck ever classic rock. But rap and urban contemporary?

#NAME?,DeMB9AsAoUMskzRStGnZmg,Okay if you're thinking about signing up for home dairy delivery you're probably wondering how it works. Here's the scoop: Once you sign up you will be assigned a delivery day based on your location. I'm in Baker just south of downtown Denver and it's Wednesday here. You can set a weekly order and adjust it up until 7pm of the night before your order. They offer milk (of course) juices cheese butter eggs cookie dough bottled water chip dips and plenty of other stuff. The deliveries for me are made before I leave for work which is at 5:50am. On my walk to the bus I do pass the delivery truck so it can't be too terribly long before that. Milk has never been hot or frozen when I take it in.

The front desk agent was super helpful with suggesting places to eat and upgrading our room for a view of Lake Michigan. The concierge was even MORE helpful with bus routes subway routes and best ways to get to certain sights to see. Sitting at one end of the Magnificent Mile and right on the banks of Lake Michigan this old historic hotel offers so much if you want to experience a luxurious elegant visit to Chicago. From the high ceilings in the lobby to the live music in the lobby lounge to the breakfast at the Drake Brothers restaurant to the track record of amazing celebs and royalty that have stayed beneath the roof this hotel can in no way leave you anything but breathless.

The ice gets scraped into a cup and you have a delicious icey feast to indulge yourself. I only stop in when I'm in the area but sometimes it seems to require an Italian Ice just to make my day.

This little lunch spot is a catering service turned sandwich/salad shop. I think the owner could benefit from spending a little time in an actual restaurant kitchen because the ordering system (written down long-hand on a pad) and kitchen staff (slow moving ladies) aren't up to par for such a busy lunch place. The system is...walk in wait in a (sometimes quite long) line to place your order at the counter. Go find a seat and wait (awhile if they're busy) for your order to be brought out...they'll call your name. Wait in the line again after you eat to pay.

#NAME?,OapLWhQI4_Gm32-nYbHmUA,Scoop is a lovely treat on a hot summer's day while wandering round Covent Garden. Well worth a small detour from the main shopping area. Scoop serves gelato ice cream which seems more creamy than usual English ice cream but not as creamy as Haagen Dazs. There is a wide selection of flavours but not as wide as suggested on their website. Another slight problem is that the queue frequently stretches out of the door and it's hard to get a good view of all the flavours available. They're very happy to give you little tasters if you're not sure of your choice. There is a choice of cones available. Another little tip is that they will give you a combination of 2 flavours in a single scoop which are usually very generous in size. Scoop is my little treat to myself on a hot summer's day in Cove,5,2,3/20/2009,OapLWhQI4_Gm32-nYbHmUA,754,1693,0

#NAME?,PLOYtrCMUFPHQe2IbYAd5g,I was in Paris a few months back and came home with a nasty macaron addiction. Trying to find something even close to laudree has been a challenge....until I stopped at vanille on Saturday. Of course I had to get the 40 piece assortment for $35 which is a good price considering macarons are expensive. Vanille gets the texture and fillings exactly right - I'm finding that I like the more delicate flavors (rose lavender raspberry) while the husband likes the chocolate/caramel ones. We also took home a few entrements - cheesecake and chocolate mousse. It is rare to eat a cheesecake anything that can be described as light but this little jewel of a cake was.

I went with a regular old bagle and cream cheese and it was ok but I like a little more shmear than they provided even though I did request and offer to pay for more. The atmosphere is great if you like some edge. I did since Boulder seems to lack a hell of a lot of edge.

Â We decided what the heck let's hit the aquarium since it's convenient and will take the right amount of time to see before we have to be at a theater show at 3:00. Of course the aquarium is somewhat pricey I think $16 per person for adults but we had a coupon from some parking structure that gave us $2 off per person so that helped. Overall this is a very nice aquarium. Â Their use of elevators to move guests through the exhibits and keep traffic moving was interesting!

I love the layout of the rooms with their section sofa and large screen tv.

The outlet boasts that you can save 30%-70% 'every day' which is pretty realistic. This location is never that busy so you can usually shop without much interruption or annoyances from other customers and excessive sales staff.

#NAME?,UuIr2WKA0gZRyRvWIlAduQ,I came back again this year with my company for our annual St. Patrick's Day party. This year we didn't go on St. Patrick's Day so it wasn't nearly as crowded and we got to see the entire menu which was nice. The atmosphere is fun and our waitress was outstanding. I'm just not impressed with their food at all. I got the pulled pork sandwich...and I think I make better pulled pork. It wasn't saucy and the bun was soggy. Their drinks were pretty watered down as well. It's not the worst place I've been to but I wouldn't recommend it or come back here outside of my work parties.,3,5,Update - 3/16/2012,UuIr2WKA0gZRyRvWIlAduQ,70,587,0
#NAME?,bspbvQ0HdWRDkM3YYduuLg,I like this place because it has a nice family feel to it. It's kind of nice to get away from the chain restaurants and try something different. We tried this place because we had a coupon. I like that they had nice healthy servings of fresh bread before the meal and the chicken parm that I ordered satisfied a craving. It was not anything special or out of the ordinary but it did the trick. The mozzarella caprese was traditional and expected but it was very good and fresh. I have also ordered the chicken piccata which is also pretty good. The decor could be updated a bit as it seems a bit old but overall the meal was a typical American Italian meal. I would go back there again because it definitely fulfills a craving for Italian food but I wouldn't go there expecting a really nice ,3,0,4/3/2012,bspbvQ0HdWRDkM3YYduuLg,11,182,0

Their more traditional coffee drinks are always top notch and while their specialty drinks all look a bit too sweet for my taste I have it on good authority that they are in fact quite tasty. They also do regular coffee in many different forms: drip french press and pour over. I've never had a pour over but barista friends tell me that it'll change my life.

For the trey trey out of the 6 of us there 5 got the steak frites with half salad half fries. The steak had no char and was underwhelming.

#NAME?,HMFAz4K5ZeMXcAhbEmMS-Q,My husband and I visited last year during my company's picnic. It was fun and cool to check a new zoo. I thought some of the exhibits were rather small and the hours of some of the others were wacky. They did have some exhibits that were nicer then other zoo's though. This zoo has a little more difficult walking then others because you have to walk up and down lots of hills like other parts of Cincinnati. You can't go wrong with a day trip to check out the Cincinnati Zoo no matter how old you are. I would like to go back and check it out again.,4,0,4/6/2012,HMFAz4K5ZeMXcAhbEmMS-Q,10,92,0

Three women cleaned the house and it seemed to be pretty quick so I was pleasantly surprised to find that the house was left almost spotless. I do realize that most cleaning services are up front about the fact that it may take 3 or so cleanings to get the house completely cleaned. I was told on the phone that the first cleaning would be considered a deep cleaning and so was told an estimate of between 130 and 180 for the size of the house. Now I completely understand that without seeing the house and the level of cleanliness there would be a give or take 50 dollars. Plus I have two cats. All cool and clear about that.

The restaurant staff was friendly and provided a delicious free dessert for the birthday boy.

Much like many other places I visit in the keys the atmosphere at Pepe's is so cool & cozy... it almost feels like you're in a tree house on their back patio. Seating is pretty limited but you're more than welcome to grab a drink at the bar while you wait and the most important thing to know about Pepe's is that every single one of their juices are fresh squeezed... they actually do it in front of you at the bar.

To *try* to make a long story short we were trading a car in for a new one. While we were out examining the car we were going to buy they ran the Carfax report on the car we were trading. The man that was working with us took us back to his office and seemed distraught and explained he couldn't give us the deal he previously offered after seeing the Carfax - apparently the car had a salvaged title and had all these accidents and stuff. This was news to us as we had owned the car for the past few years and hadn't known any of this.

The staff was really on their game replenishing things frequently and making sure diners had drinks etc. One of the common topics at this conference was how great the food was - one afternoon they rolled out a cart with homemade ice cream bars.

It was tasty but I would say average. I'm a bit critical when it comes to me and my shawarma's and not just any place does it for me.

#NAME?,w9TB3lYUutVaVPc7RXhSmg,I'll be the first to admit that there is NO way I would've gone here without all the great reviews from yelp. Â The outside does not look appealing at all - scary actually. Â The inside is actually very quaint and cute. Â The owner/head chef is a very nice guy who makes his rounds and gets to know every table. Â He gauges your experience with indian food/cuisine and makes suggestions based on this. Â My guess is since this is the only indian restaurant in Winchester he's used to getting newbies that need assistance. Â He's very easy to talk to and non-intimidating. Â If you've never had inidian cuisine before this would be a very safe place to try things. Â He can crank up the spice as much or as little as you'd like. Â Everything we had was very good - even the indian white wine! Go - it's good.,4,0,7/17/2012,w9TB3lYUutVaVPc7RXhSmg,2,137,0

Let me say they did a great save on the hair. They did not challenge me (it was threes longer then anyone near our table) they apologized took the entree off our bill and gave me a complimentary Margarita. Now the food it is fast cheap Mexican food. I doubt if their chips are made in house they appear to have come out of a bag and just warmed up. Their salsa is spicy and most folks would give it a thumbs up but for me there was too much onion and cilantro in it. When I crave Queso I do not just want a bowl of melted white cheese. I want cheese preferably yellow with some pizazz and kick to it. Our entrees were okay one of us order,3,3,2/13/2011,bYENop4BuQepBjM1-BI3fA,90,451,0
#NAME?,dD1_XwgaHM0oxlx2XeYgZw,My friend informs me that here during regular hours the pretty people come out to wash the sin out of their clothing. And there's science to back him up. It is proven by the census bureau demographically that all the 20-something babes live either in Cap Hill or around S. Broadway. There are also studies out that say the best romantic encounters are in laundromats while watching the other's underwear spin hypnotically into a circle of lust and despair. And those tables for folding your clothing? Just begging for something to happen. Not only does its location serve as a magnet but it is also nice and clean.

#NAME?,3qdOo7aWhIHWrKuT9jw3Gg,I've been to Olive or Twist a few times now but haven't had the urge to order food so my review is based only on my alcohol adventures. We snuck in this past weekend for a few drinks -- and to get out of the swarming crowds on Sixth and Market Square because of Light Up Night festivities. Thankfully some fantastic people told us of its upstairs bar area. What?! How did I totally miss this on my previous visits finding only a tight tiny squeeze area with happy hour-goers near the lower level bar? The openness of the upstairs only lends more positive points towards its star rating on this establishment. The beer list is decent and vodka was generously poured (read: not an overkill of cranberry and/or tonic) and bar staff was attentive -- thankfully pleasant given the rush of patrons. ,4,2,11/22/2010,3qdOo7aWhIHWrKuT9jw3Gg,33,314,0

Service was good and the waiter assistant overheard me say something about having difficulty reading the menu in the dark and offered me a flashlight. Okay that's service! Our party of three had the peppers with yuzu appetizer (good but I prefer a Spanish take on the peppers) Chilean sea bass satay (just as delicious as advertised) hot and sour soup (good) pork spring roll (excellent with excellent sauce) five spice shortribs (pretty good) Thai chicken (delightful) and some sushi (quite good).

On-mountain most the runs aren't necessarily made for beginners (note how nice easy green run Flapjack drops right into black diamond Log Chute) and the week we were there was unfortunately lacking in new snow. This resulted in the groomed areas being very rough for beginner-level snowboarders (like myself). Icy catwalks and tight turns make for some pretty epic falls and an increased need to be really aggressive with your edges. But the weather aside we had a fantastic trip.

#NAME?,h9MZv5I1hvTX1kkzq-3Cvg,I ordered the chicken kabob plate and I have to admit I was a bit surprised. The chicken was actually more like chicken pieces not cube-shaped as you would find on a kabob. It wasn't too bad as long as you have some red sauce poured over the chicken. Without the sauce the chicken would be too dry. The sauce was mild (not spicy) and it was decent. I also had the spinach and it was delicious. The food also didn't make my tummy upset which is always a plus. I do not recommend the samosa hence the three stars. Instead of being your typical triangular samosa it is more like a pastried handkerchief with the filling in the middle which is quite strange. In other words the filling can be clearly seen as opposed to having an enclosed samosa. I ordered some kind of ground meat filling (c,3,0,9/8/2012,h9MZv5I1hvTX1kkzq-3Cvg,35,285,0

#NAME?,Lc-EEXlI4xZ00L2lI0wnMw,Supper has a great atmosphere and the food is good in general and in line with pricing for moderately upscale pricing in Philly. The entrees are fancy versions of comfort food with a bit of a worldly influence ( I.e. poutine as a special). The main issue they come across is that sometimes food has too many favors and ends up being too done up for its own good. I'd highly recommend sticking to the burger the Amish chicken or the steak and avoiding the deviled eggs and the sweet potato soup. Though bot the most extensive cocktail menu the drinks are very good despite somewhat expensive price tags and the wine list is diverse.

If you are into photography (As my wife and I are) you will most definitely appreciate the wide variety of plant species and the modestly chosen colors that are combined with them. IMHO the best time of the year to go enjoy this place is probably the last week of April / First week of May. It's locally the peak for tulips and various spring flowers.

#NAME?,qmjoMFMZdLH69_6eGTGDZw,I went through the drive through this afternoon and bought a spinach salad. It was fantastic! First of all it was only $3.71 tax included. Second tons of flavorful fresh toppings. Even the bacon (which was real bacon) was crisp and good. There is a hard boiled egg that is sliced and put off to the side and easily removed for those of us who don't care for hard boiled eggs. Plenty of spinach two kinds of shredded cheese tomatoes and sliced mushrooms on a bed of iceberg lettuce comes with your choice of dressing and homemade croutons. What a bargain! I loved this salad. 4 stars because I'm a local and I think the pizza is not on the same caliber as it once was in it's glory days. But seriously try the spinach salad.

#NAME?,#NAME?,Incredible! I had the pumpkin soup - a favorite of mine - this was the second best I've had. (#1 belongs to Abay). I also had the tofu platter veggies were spot on cooked until soft but still retaining shape color and texture. My companion had the vegetable coconut soup which was overflowing with all sorts of veggies and the broth was just heavenly. He also ordered mussaman chicken curry which consisted of big chunks of chicken and potatoes that were simmered in the sweet yet spicy mussaman sauce. Â I actually ended up dipping my veggies in his sauce it was so wonderful. We both got a spice level 9 which provided just enough heat without making your nose run. The staff were friendly and efficient. Can't wait to go back.,4,1,7/15/2010,#NAME?,83,383,0

Â She asked if I wanted hot or not. Â I said hot. Â She said this disk was good because it Â was spicy but the fish had no bones. Â She was spot on. Â The dish was very tasty the sauce was smooth but I think they cooled it off for the American. Â My bald spot could have taken a pepper or two more. Â The fish was firm but tender and very mild. Â The hot and sour soup was very good too. Â I would definitely recommend this place for Chinese in the area. I also saw two other very telling things.

We settled on the strawberry cheesecake and the german chocolate cake- both were very good. Â I would vote that the strawberry cheesecake was better than the Cheesecake Fantasy that I used to say was my favorite ice cream from Coldstone.

We were also fortunate enough to be the first table to order so our food came out really quickly. I went this Saturday and I'll have to admit this was the first time I've been here and really had my patience tested with the wait. The wait outside wasn't too bad actually- only about 10-15 minutes. The wait to order and then to get our food was really long though- well over an hour. This would have been OK if we could at least chat and relax but the music was so loud we could barely hear ourselves think.

On our 'romantic' weekend in Kenosha to celebrate my birthday he discovered the Jelly Belly factory and had I not agreed to go I would have spent the weekend with a pouting 48/12 year old. It was actually kind of fun. The warehouse is tricked out in a low budget Disney-esque manner with over sized signs and giant videos describing the Jelly Belly process. An ad for JB but interesting. My 48/12 loved the gift shop. I think he spent $75 on discount candy. Yeah I'm like 'how many jelly beans can one man eat?' but he was out to discover the answer.

#NAME?,faaOI6hU64h6SSaF0f11eg,Coney Islands...what are they good for? Absolutely Nothing. Ok that may be bit harsh but I really want Â to put my fine dining experience here behind me. Â Get it? Â Behind me? The dogs are basic low quality steamed and slapped into a bun. Â The chili sauce is a bit too runny for me but apparently that helps it get squeezed through the pneumatic grease gun quicker. Â It certainly helped it go through me quicker. The cheese is liquid squirt-on. Â The onions are pretty good though diced beyond recognition they take on a goopy onion-paste appearance. So the overall coney island dog? Â Let's just say edible. Â  Worth a return trip? Â Only if I was bringing the police there to identify the crime scene. Â Why do I give them a generous two stars if my review basically states they are one bad meal away,2,0,4/28/2010,faaOI6hU64h6SSaF0f11eg,68,518,0
#NAME?,bcTU9jRBOxWck4WApiC1tQ,Big and never ending! This was another stop on a weekend with friends and family. We had just been to a craft fair and various other shopping meccas so this was pretty good but not too impressive for me. The General Store is a combination of a craft fair and a Patina-esque gift shop. I couldn't believe how big the place was! The upstairs has that kitchy I don't need it but want to buy it kind of feeling which I enjoy. I bought a few Christmas ornaments and a wine stopper. The Christmas ornaments aren't out yet of course but unfortunately the wine stopper has already lost it's suction. I do not live anywhere near this place but would consider take a day trip on a boring weekend afternoon with friends. What I would not do is eat at the cafe. The lines are too long the help too inept,3,0,11/14/2010,bcTU9jRBOxWck4WApiC1tQ,25,316,0

#NAME?,dsu43n2DOR_pB07P1sOOZg,I do love their Soon Doo Boo. Â I think it's the best in the area for Soon Doo Boo. Â The Soups and Bahn Chans (side dishes) are very home style. Â I think it's the owner is the chef. Â  In the evening you get a nice little Pa Jun appetizer for free as part of the service and the Shik Hae (sweet rice punch) at the end. Â Love that!! So much better than the stuff from a can!! Wonder if I can order it as a dessert? The server is very nice but it's only her. Â I've never seen more than one server and there are only 6 tables so it's not so bad. One bad thing is that it's super super busy here at lunch. Â If you've only an hour to spare call ahead for take out other wise get ready to wait and hover for tables.,3,2,12/11/2008,dsu43n2DOR_pB07P1sOOZg,50,322,1
#NAME?,h51H-UsPhZgmPkdsjqz68g,I've eaten at Sen Yai Sen Lek three times in the past month. I like their values and I like that all my garbage is getting recycled. (Should I clean out my purse and leave all my stray receipts on the table? Will they be composted?!) Anyway they have a few incredible meals and a few duds. Khao Soi: a giant--it's BIG--bowl of yellow curry soup with soft noodles on bottom and fried crunchy noodles on top. The flavor is medium but I always add Thai chilies to make it a little spicier. Very smooth and enough to split with another person. Tod Mun: curried fish cakes. This appetizer is light and comes with five little patties and a deliciously fresh cilantro cucumber peanut relish. Pad See Iew Gai: tastes good like most Pad See Yew except this is one of the few restaurants that actually uses Ch,4,3,8/3/2010,h51H-UsPhZgmPkdsjqz68g,72,379,0

Â But I ended up having a lovely time and enjoyed my food well enough. Â I got 3 meals out of it so I guess it was a good value. Â Mostly I was impressed with our server. Â I didn't catch his name but apparently he's worked there forever. Â He was really fantastic and is what made me give it 3 stars over just 2.,3,0,5/3/2009,hNBPq9LkONSSyJkOpWSjYQ,44,231,1
#NAME?,NZsdxzjFepRypRbqQZuEdw,We came upon this little restaurant on Diversey while walking back to our car after seeing a movie at the Landmark and it was an absoutely fantastic discovery for us!! We sat outside on their small sidewalk seating area & the service was superb-very friendly waiter & waitress & the owner even came up to greet us during dinner. Now for the food---it was awesome! We ordered the appetizer sampler with hummus salad grape leaves olives etc & it was so fresh & good. I had the chicken dish that starts with an F (can't remember). The chicken was tender & the sauce that covered it was so rich & tasty. I can't wait to go back there but we live in the burbs. Oh I forgot to mention that we got dessert too. Vanilla Ice cream with honey on top. It was simple & perfect!,5,1,6/7/2008,NZsdxzjFepRypRbqQZuEdw,0,11,1

#NAME?,OapLWhQI4_Gm32-nYbHmUA,My parents sister and I had a fun informative but cold day aboard the Gray Line hop on hop off tour of New York today. We bought our tickets in Times Square and a tip - the price we were offered was lower than the offers on the internet. We also got reduced entry to the Rockefeller Centre. There are 3 loops and we did the downtown and Brooklyn loops today. The downtown has more of the tourist sights and my parents found the Brooklyn tour a little boring. The tour guides were informative and the downtown loop lady was also quite funny with great dining tips as well. The buses are completely open air up top and though they supply ponchos be aware that it is very exposed on cold wet day like today. Overall a solid way to see New York.

#NAME?,XYSDrIef7g4Gmp3lNFVO6A,Another Gusto di Vita coffee kiosk - in the back of the parking lot in the Warrenton Village Shopping Center. It's in what I suspect used to be a drive-up ATM bank building (the one located in New Baltimore is in a converted drive thru ATM) - so it has no physical address - not sure how Google maps will end up depicting this location. You can drive up on either side of the kiosk and place an order. I ordered a medium coffee with cream and one Splenda. I tasted my coffee before driving off (my last experience at a Gusto di Vita was at the New Baltimore location and the coffee was terrible) See: http://www.yelp.com/biz/â€¦ However the coffee this time around was excellent! So I will have to give the New Baltimore location a second shot some time soon. And I will be back here again! Check thi,4,0,9/6/2008,XYSDrIef7g4Gmp3lNFVO6A,1388,2530,0
#NAME?,NfU0zDaTMEQ4-X9dbQWd9A,I grew up with this little Malley's Chocolate and ice cream shop although I will say I've never been a big chocolate fan. We always went for the hard-packed ice creams and warm fudge and caramel sauces. Yes I realize that fudge=chocolate but for some reason when this glorious stuff runs down your sundae nothing can keep you from eating it. Anyways I really haven't had a reason to visit a Malley's recently but I needed to bring a little Cleveland treat to my co-workers for our regional trip to DC. So I stopped in and with the help of a couple of teens I found a large box of buckeyes and a smaller box of some sort of toffee/chocolate/almond bark to pack along in my luggage. The service was pretty OK while the teens didn't know really how to help me. But I can't really make a full-on ,4,2,10/5/2012,NfU0zDaTMEQ4-X9dbQWd9A,76,440,0
#NAME?,nt143HoSFyPLsVNaI1fGrQ,I am not going to waste anyone's time by telling you what the place looked like what all they sell whether or not I got friendly service... I don't think it matters. Â The chocolate is a little piece of heaven. A BIG piece of heaven. Â They may be expensive but those truffles are better than drugs. Â I would do pretty much anything for these truffles... and I do mean anything. Â They are rich and delicious and ohmygosh- I think I need to drive to Coloma and get some right now. Â  Mmmmm. LUCKILY!! You do not need to drive to Coloma. Â You can order this delicious goodness. Â If that someone special in your life is a chocolate lover and you love them - you would probably order some for them. :),5,2,11/18/2009,nt143HoSFyPLsVNaI1fGrQ,49,266,0
#NAME?,e0lV0WyRCYbYs9k6chh8YA,This review is for the Pasta Demonstration and Luncheon that was part of Vegas Uncorked 2009. The event started with an introduction by Hugh Garvey from Bon Appetit Magazine. Then Chef Carlos took us through the process for making several types of Pasta and answered questions from the audience. I think he would make an outstanding TV Chef. He was funny informative and engaging. Before the presentation we got to sample some Prosecco and Arancini (little fried balls of rice that were stuffed with beef and cheese). They were both wonderful! After the demonstration we were treated to a buffet that included an antipasto platter a wonderful pear salad with Balsamic Sherry Vinaigrette Tortelloni Raviolini and some wonderful Lobster Gnocchi.

#NAME?,gWrfDg97-1GtQVVUhuUKBQ,Let's start with two words that can make your mouth melt BUTTER CRUST. I know that you're either a Gino's or Giordano's fan when it comes to your deep dish pizza but I think Lou Malnati's is underrated. Do I think the other aforementioned two was great? Yes but Â I think Lou Malnati's can roll with the big boys of deep dish pizza too. If you've never had deep dish pizza before and are going to Chicago give your self some time allowance because it takes about 30 minutes at least to cook a nice deep dish pizza and also the lines that can wrap around the place. We got smart. My husband has never eaten deep dish pizza in his life so I took him at lunch time where he can experience better time to eat deep dish pizza. We both had to share the personal deep dish pizza because it was huge enough,4,0,8/4/2012,gWrfDg97-1GtQVVUhuUKBQ,1,123,1

#NAME?,AX6TWJtUn0UXKROrR7ZdAw,I brought my son who is slightly autistic to the Community Memorial Hospital Emergency Department due to a medication issue and several nurses made disparaging and threatening statements about him. Â This was very disturbing and a violation of his rights as someone with a mental illness. During our visit it was apparent that the Emergency Room staff had either little or no training or little or no empathy for people with special needs or just plain didn't care who they spoke to or what they said. Although I know that sometimes emergency medical situations dictate that you go to the nearest hospital if you have a special needs child I recommend that you take them elsewhere.,1,1,5/19/2010,AX6TWJtUn0UXKROrR7ZdAw,133,287,0

But you know what? it is still a sprawling city concrete asphalt and steel and cars and noise stretching for miles. Even with all of the parks in the city it can can be difficult to just get away from it all. I have found my mental getaway right there. It is the place to go in the winter as it is is about 80 degrees with an 80% humidity! The conservatory is really put together beautifully. I am sure there are many plant species they don't have here but I would be hard pressed to name one.

Â I was pleasantly surprised to find it much to the liking of a Subway but refined and truly fresher ingredients. Â The service was ok not really over excited to serve but I imagine that's because this place gets really packed so they stick to the business at hand. Â I got there around 11:30am and any later I would have been in line with about 20 other people. Â This place gets packed! Â Of course a couple other good things about this location is that if the weather is good there isn't a much better patio for eating then right there outside out front of Hearst Tower.
